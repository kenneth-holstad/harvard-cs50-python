A lot of python knowledge at this introductory level is, frankly, trivial
As just knowing what package you can use to do certain things can save you a lot of work
I've been interviewed before and asked questions where you were expected to know certain packages

Thus, I should build a specific catalog of packages used and learned about in this course and other places
including usage examples
also include pip installations
TODO: I have some of this already - add this to python-scripts repository

I will want to specifically study and maintain familiarity with these resources
