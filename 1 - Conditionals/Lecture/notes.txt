Conditionals are self-explanatory
Built-in symbols for python: >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=

if statements are pretty simple to do in python
they'll use boolean values which you can create with conditional statements
General form (statement is a conditional statement, code is whatever you want):

if statement:
    code
elif statement:
    code
else:
    code

see that you don't need () or anything else around the conditions
You can include (or not include) as many of each step as you want, and it'll flow logically

you can use the literal words and/or in your conditional statements

"Pythonic" programming is the term for certain coding practices that are python-specific
that are typically very clean and use specific features of python
example:

you can shorten this function to something more pythonic
old:
def is_even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

new:
def is_even(n):
    return True if n % 2 == 0 else False

even more pythonic:
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

match is another way to do similar conditional logic (it's similar to switch in java, etc)
general form:

match variable:
    case value:
        code
    case value:
        code
    case _:
        code

case _: is the "else"
that _ will have use in other contexts in python as well
match will be useful for more powerful forms of matching
