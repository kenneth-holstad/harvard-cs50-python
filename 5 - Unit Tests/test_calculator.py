before learning assert you could do the opposite by checking for falsehoods:

from calculator import square


def main():
    test_square()


def test_square():
    if square(2) != 4:
        print("2 squared was not 4")
    if square(3) != 9:
        print("3 squared was not 9")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Simpler usage of pytest

def test_square():
    assert square(2) == 4
    assert square(3) == 9
    assert square(-2) == 4
    assert square(-3) == 9
    assert square(0) == 0

# split into more clear test cases

    assert square(2) == 4
    assert square(3) == 9


def test_negative():
    assert square(-2) == 4
    assert square(-3) == 9


def test_zero():
    assert square(0) == 0
