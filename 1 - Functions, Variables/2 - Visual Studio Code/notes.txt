VS Code is an open source IDE available to download to computer
It's also available in the cloud
CS50 has its own implementation:

code.cs50.io

You have your own container up there to store files, install programs, etc. (uses Linux)
Interact via CLI and GUI

Commands in this space:
code makes a new file (ex: code hello.py)
Standard linux commands (ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, cd, rmdir, clear, etc)

The rest of the lesson is just navigating around in Linux...
