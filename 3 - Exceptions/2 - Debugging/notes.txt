Common debugging methods - many of these I already do

basic example: print variable value at various points of code, such as in a loop

fortunately, more powerful tools also exist in python and vscode

in vscode and some other tools, one built in debugging method is "breakpoints"
that allows you to step slowly through the code step by step to monitor progress
you do this in vscode by clicking the line number(s) you want, and then running the debugger
this will show you things like variable values, etc.
"step into" button lets you go stepwise, "step over" would execute and skip the next step
