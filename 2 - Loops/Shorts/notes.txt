See report.py for notes on working with dictionaries describing an object
    includes get() function to assist in null handling

See distances.py for using a dictionary as key-value pairs instead
    includes keys() function to iterate by keys, values() function to iterate by values, and items() function to iterate by items

TODO: I need to be VERY familiar with these dicts and all different ways to use them. Revisit this at the end of course
