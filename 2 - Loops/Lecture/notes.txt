syntax for loops is similar to conditionals

while, for loops
see meow.py for basic loops

you can do += to do a basic iteration (e.g. i += 1 instead of i = i + 1)

for loops generally iterate using a list
you can iterate over many objects, doesn't have to be numbers
you can make a basic list using range()
	note: range(5) produces [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
you may use _ as the iteration variable (after "for") as you don't care about the variable

there is a pythonic way to do multiple prints:
# extra \n is produced without end part
print("meow\n" * x, end="")

it's common to deliberately introduce an infinite loop when you are asking for user input
which you will break out of when they give you the input you want, start with
while True:

you can use this however you want with conditional loops inside, and continue/break commands

for lists:
length command is len()
you can access an index with list[x]

two ways to iterate over a list:
for student in students:
for i in range(len(students)):

See Shorts/results.py for usage of functions to modify lists:
    append, remove, reverse, extend, insert

another type of data type is dict
technically speaking, they are a set of key-value pairs
to create a dict, create key-value pairs between {}:
students = {
    "Hermoine": "Gryffindor",
    "Harry": "Gryffindor",
    "Ron": "Gryffindor",
    "Draco": "Slytherin",
}
# interestingly, python is forgiving to having a comma at the end as above. it also works without.

you can can create a list of dictionaries as follows:
students = [
    {"name": "Hermoine", "house": "Gryffindor", "patronus": "Otter"},
    {"name": "Harry", "house": "Gryffindor", "patronus": "Stag"},
    {"name": "Ron", "house": "Gryffindor", "patronus": "Jack Russell terrier"},
    {"name": "Draco", "house": "Slytherin", "patronus": None},
]
# note: None is a keyword for null

documentation on dict's: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries

See Shorts/report.py for notes on working with dictionaries describing an object
    includes get() function to assist in null handling

See Shorts/distances.py for using a dictionary as key-value pairs instead
    includes keys() function to iterate by keys, values() function to iterate by values, and items() function to iterate by items

TODO: dicts are one of the most important things in this course, I likely need to go above and beyond this course in practicing with these.
TODO: I need to be VERY familiar with these dicts and all different ways to use them. Revisit this at the end of course

rest of lesson (mario example) is about nested loops
