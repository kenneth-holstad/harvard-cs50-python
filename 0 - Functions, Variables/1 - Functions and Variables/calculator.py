x = input("X?")
y = input("Y?")

# Note: this will produce a concatenated output because inputs were strings
# z = x + y

# if you only want integers
# print(int(x) + int(y))
print(float(x) + float(y))

# you could have also nested int at the top, i.e.
# x = int(input("X?"))
# y = int(input("Y?"))
# print(x + y)
